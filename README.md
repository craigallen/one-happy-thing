Once I had it working, I customized some of the design and changed the button functionality to work so you can click anywhere on the page. Then, I added a JavaScript function to check whether the new quote was the same as the one already loaded. If so, it would find a new random quote and keep comparing it until the new one is different. This ensures the same quote is never loaded twice in a row, resulting in what would appear to be a non-click by the user.
